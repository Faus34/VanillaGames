### Chrome-TRex-game
This is a game made in pure HTML CSS and JavaScript.
The objective of this project is to practice my JS animation skills, it simulates the popular Chrome T Rex game.
The game doesn't use any framework or canvas and it also helped me learn about nodes, adding Children to parents using .appendChild(),
and removing them using .removeChild() as well as other important things.
The game was originally developed by Kubowania as part of a JS tutorial. Here is her Youtube channel link: [https://www.youtube.com/aniakubow]
In order to improve the original game I am adding compatibilty features and other characteristics to make it more easy to use.
